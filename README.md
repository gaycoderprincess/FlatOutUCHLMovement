## Building

Building is done on an Arch Linux system with CLion being used for the build process. 

Before you begin, clone [nya-common](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common), [nya-common-fouc](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common-fouc) and [FreemanAPI](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/FreemanAPI) to folders next to this one, so they can be found.

You should be able to build the project now in CLion.

After building, make sure to also get BASS from https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html
