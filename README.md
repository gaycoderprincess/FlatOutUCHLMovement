## Building

Building is done on an Arch Linux system with CLion being used for the build process. 

Before you begin, clone [nya-common](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common) and [nya-common-fouc](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common-fouc) to a folder next to this one, so it can be found.

You should be able to build the project now in CLion.
